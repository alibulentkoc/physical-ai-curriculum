# Lesson 6.2 — A Pose Is a Transformation

## 1. Why This Matters

Here's the unification that makes everything click: an object's **pose** in a frame *is* a **transform** between frames. "The gripper's pose in the base frame" is the SE(3) transform that converts base coordinates to gripper coordinates (and its inverse goes the other way). This means poses chain by composition exactly like the transforms of Unit 5 — so "gripper in world" is just "gripper in base" composed with "base in world." This is the bridge from pose to the full pipeline.

## 2. Physical Intuition

Saying "the gripper sits *here*, turned *this way*, relative to the base" is the same as giving the recipe to go from the base's coordinates to the gripper's. The pose *is* that recipe. And recipes chain: if you know the gripper relative to the base, and the base relative to the world, you know the gripper relative to the world — just follow both recipes in turn. So tracking where everything is becomes tracking a set of poses and **composing** them along the frame graph from Unit 5.

## 3. Mathematical Foundations

Write $T_{B\leftarrow A}$ for the pose of frame $A$ expressed in frame $B$ — equivalently, the transform taking $A$-coordinates to $B$-coordinates: $\mathbf{p}_B = T_{B\leftarrow A}\,\mathbf{p}_A$. Then poses compose just like transforms:

$$T_{\text{world}\leftarrow \text{gripper}} = T_{\text{world}\leftarrow \text{base}}\; T_{\text{base}\leftarrow \text{gripper}}.$$

A point given in the gripper frame becomes a world point by applying the gripper's world pose. The inverse swaps the roles: $T_{A\leftarrow B} = (T_{B\leftarrow A})^{-1}$ (the base's pose relative to the gripper is the inverse of the gripper's pose relative to the base). Pose = transform is why the Unit 5 machinery (compose along the path, invert backward edges) applies directly to poses.

## 5. Engineering Example

The robot stores each link's pose relative to the previous frame (gripper→base, base→world). To find the gripper in the world, it composes them — exactly the frame-graph path from Unit 5. To bring a world-frame waypoint into the gripper's own frame (to act on it), it uses the inverse. Pose bookkeeping and transform composition are literally the same operation.

## 6. Worked Example

Base pose in world: $T_{w\leftarrow b}$ = translate $(1, 0, 0)$, no rotation. Gripper pose in base: $T_{b\leftarrow g}$ = translate $(0, 0, 0.5)$, no rotation. Gripper pose in world:
$$T_{w\leftarrow g} = T_{w\leftarrow b}\,T_{b\leftarrow g} = \text{translate}(1, 0, 0.5).$$
A point at the gripper's origin $(0,0,0,1)$ in the gripper frame maps to $(1, 0, 0.5)$ in the world — composing the two poses placed it correctly.

## 7. Interactive Demonstration

**Guided prediction.** Given the gripper's pose in the base and the base's pose in the world, predict the product that gives the gripper's pose in the world (which order?). Then predict how you'd express a world-frame target in the gripper's own frame (which inverse?). Confirm the inner frame names cancel.

## 8. Coding Exercise

!!! tip "Run the hands-on notebook"
    `modules/module02/notebooks/M02_U06_L6_2_A_Pose_Is_A_Transformation.ipynb` — open in JupyterLab and run **Kernel → Restart & Run All**.

Represent base→world and gripper→base poses as SE(3) matrices; compose to get gripper→world; carry a gripper-frame point to the world; use the inverse to bring a world point into the gripper frame.

A check that a pose is the frame-to-frame transform, that poses compose like transforms, and that the inverse swaps the frame roles.

## 10. Challenge Problem

You have gripper→base and base→world. A camera is mounted on the gripper with known camera→gripper. Write the camera→world pose, and the transform that expresses a world goal in the camera frame.

## 11. Common Mistakes

- Composing poses in the wrong order (inner frame labels must match).
- Forgetting that the inverse swaps which frame is the reference.
- Treating pose bookkeeping as separate from transform composition (they're the same).

## 12. Key Takeaways

- An object's **pose** in a frame **is** the transform between those frames.
- Poses **compose** like transforms: $T_{w\leftarrow g} = T_{w\leftarrow b}\,T_{b\leftarrow g}$.
- The **inverse** swaps reference and object frames.
- This is why Unit 5's compose/invert machinery applies directly to poses.
